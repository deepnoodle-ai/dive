All tests should use the Go package "github.com/stretchr/testify/require".

Its functions include:

- func Equal(t TestingT, expected interface{}, actual interface{}, msgAndArgs ...interface{})
- func NoError(t TestingT, err error, msgAndArgs ...interface{})
- func NotEmpty(t TestingT, object interface{}, msgAndArgs ...interface{})

Among others. Use the full set of require functions to keep tests concise.

Strongly prefer using the `require` package functions instead of the `assert` package, unless it's important to allow multiple assertions to fail for a given case.
