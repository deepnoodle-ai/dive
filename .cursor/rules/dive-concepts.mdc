# Dive Concepts

## Environment

An environment is a running Dive configuration containing:

- One or more AI agents
- Task definitions that define units of work
- Workflow definitions that define steps to run
- Environment configuration
- Triggers that cause workflows to start executing
- When a workflow is triggered it creates an "execution"

## Workflow

A Workflow is a template for a repeatable process:

- Has defined inputs and outputs
- Can be triggered manually or automatically
- Can invoke other workflows (supporting composition)
- Each workflow execution is tracked independently
- Consists of a directed graph that defines execution steps

## Task

A Task defines a reusable unit of work:

- May be run one or more times in a Workflow
- Defines a specific action
- Some types are executed by agents
- Other types may execute scripts or take other non-agent action
- Has defined inputs and outputs
- Examples: "research topic X", "summarize webpage", etc.

## Execution

An execution represents a single run of a Workflow:

- Maintains state and history for each step
- May have multiple active execution paths
- May be long-running
- Executes the Workflow's graph of steps

## Agent

An Agent is an AI entity that takes action:

- May be assigned tasks to help with Workflows
- Has a defined name, description, and instructions that together define its role
- May have "memory" so that it can recall what it previously worked on
- May be a "supervisor", which allows it to assign work to other agents

## Documents

- Store structured or unstructured data
- May be read or written by Agents and Tasks

## Tables

- Structured data storage for Agents
- Queryable by Agents and Tasks within Workflows

## Memory

- Persistent context for an Agent
- Supports agent learning and adaptation
- Can be cleared or preserved

## Triggers

- Event-based workflow initiators
- Can fire based on a schedule or external events
- Creates a Workflow Execution when it fires

## Integrations

- Incoming and outgoing connections to external systems
- Can be part of a Task, Trigger, or Tool

## Tools

- Used by Agents to take action in the world
- May be read-only (for querying) or take some active action
