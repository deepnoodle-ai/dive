# Dive Overview

Dive is a powerful AI toolkit for Go that enables developers to create intelligent agents, automate complex workflows, and seamlessly integrate with leading LLM providers. Whether you're building autonomous assistants, orchestrating data pipelines, or prototyping AI-native applications, Dive provides the foundation you need.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

Dive is built around four key principles:

1. **Simplicity** - Clean APIs and intuitive concepts that developers can quickly understand
2. **Flexibility** - Modular architecture that adapts to your specific use cases
3. **Reliability** - Checkpoint-based execution and robust error handling
4. **Interoperability** - Works with multiple LLM providers and external systems

## 🧱 Key Components

### Agents
Intelligent AI entities that can:
- Respond to natural language conversations
- Execute tasks autonomously using tools
- Delegate work to other agents (supervisor pattern)
- Maintain persistent conversation history

```go
agent, err := agent.New(agent.Options{
    Name:         "Research Assistant",
    Instructions: "You are an expert researcher who helps analyze topics thoroughly.",
    Model:        anthropic.New(),
    Tools:        []dive.Tool{webSearchTool, documentTool},
})
```

### Workflows
Declarative, multi-step processes defined in YAML:
- Conditional branching and parallel execution
- Script integration for custom logic
- Checkpoint-based state management
- Real-time event streaming

```yaml
Workflows:
  - Name: Research Pipeline
    Steps:
      - Name: Search Web
        Agent: Research Assistant
        Prompt: "Research ${inputs.topic}"
        Store: research_data
      - Name: Analyze Results
        Agent: Data Analyst
        Prompt: "Analyze this data: ${research_data}"
```

### Environment
Runtime container that orchestrates agents and workflows:
- Shared document repositories
- Thread management for conversations
- Tool and action registry
- MCP server connections

### Tools
Extensible capabilities that agents can use:
- Built-in: web search, file operations, command execution
- Custom: implement the `Tool` interface for domain-specific needs
- MCP: connect to Model Context Protocol servers
- Type-safe with rich annotations

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. Agent Interaction
```
User Input → Agent → LLM Provider → Tool Calls → Results → Response
```

Agents receive input, process it through their configured LLM, potentially make tool calls to gather information or take actions, and return structured responses.

### 2. Workflow Execution
```
Inputs → Step Execution → State Updates → Checkpoints → Next Steps
```

Workflows execute steps sequentially or in parallel, updating shared state and creating checkpoints for reliability. Each step can involve agent interactions, script execution, or custom actions.

### 3. Event Flow
```
Execution Events → Streaming → Real-time Updates → UI/Monitoring
```

Both agents and workflows emit detailed events that can be streamed to UIs, monitoring systems, or other downstream processes.
