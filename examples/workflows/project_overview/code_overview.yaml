        Prompt: |
          Your goal is to identify key files and information in a given codebase.

          The codebase is:
          ${inputs.directory}

          Walk what seem to be the key directories and files in the codebase.

          Read what seem to be the most important files and summarize them.

          Identify:
          - The purpose of the project
          - Key concepts and ideas
          - An overview of code organization and structure
          - Any other important context for understanding the project

          Respond with a markdown formatted summary of the key files and
          information in the codebase.

      - Name: Generate Project Overview
        Agent: Engineer
        Prompt: |
          Your goal is to generate a project overview for a given codebase.

          Here is some initial information about the project to get you started:
          ${initial_summary}

          Continue researching the project as needed to gather more information.

          Now write a project overview in markdown format (about 500 words, not more).

          The overview should include:
          - The purpose of the project
          - Key concepts and ideas
          - An overview of code organization and structure
          - Any other important context for understanding the project

          Write clearly and concisely for a technical audience.
