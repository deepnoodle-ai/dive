    Description: 'Create a Go main program skeleton from user intent'
    Inputs:
      - Name: intent
        Type: string
        Description: 'Describe what the Go program should do'
      - Name: directory
        Type: string

    Steps:
      - Name: Generate main.go
        Agent: Engineer
        Prompt: |
          Based on the following intent, generate a minimal but idiomatic Go
          main program in a file called main.go:

          "${inputs.intent}"

          Create the program in the directory: ${inputs.directory}.

          Make sure the program is formatted and linted.

          Confirm it compiles cleanly.

        Prompt: |
          We were working on creating a Go program based on the following intent:

          "${inputs.intent}"

          Here is the results of our work:

          ${results}

          Summarize whether the program compiled and linted cleanly. If there were errors, list them.
