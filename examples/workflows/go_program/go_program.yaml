    Description: 'Create a Go main program skeleton from user intent'
    Inputs:
      - Name: intent
        Type: string
        Description: 'Describe what the Go program should do'
      - Name: directory
        Type: string
        Description: 'Directory to create the Go program in'
        Default: 'The current directory'
    Steps:
      - Name: Generate main.go
        Agent: Engineer
        Prompt: |
          Based on the following intent, generate a minimal but idiomatic Go
          main program in a file called main.go:

          "${inputs.intent}"

          Create the program in the directory: ${inputs.directory}.

      - Name: Compile Program
        Agent: Engineer
        Prompt: |
          Compile the Go program in the directory: ${inputs.directory}.

      - Name: Lint Program
        Agent: Engineer
        Prompt: |
          Run `go vet ./...` in the program directory: ${inputs.directory}.
        Store: lint_output

      - Name: Summarize Results
        Agent: Engineer
        Prompt: |
          Here is the lint output:
          ${lint_output}

          Summarize whether the program compiled and linted cleanly. If there were errors, list them.
