## From the Docs

> When passing thinking and redacted_thinking blocks back to the API in a
> multi-turn conversation, you must include the complete unmodified block back
> to the API for the last assistant turn.

> This is critical for maintaining the modelâ€™s reasoning flow. We suggest always
> passing back all thinking blocks to the API. For more details, see the
> Preserving thinking blocks section below.
